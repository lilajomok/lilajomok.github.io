# {{ page.title }}

I'm a data analyst currently residing in Southern California. I mostly work in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html) with a focus on building statistical models.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics from the [University of California, Riverside](http://www.ucr.edu/) in June 2016.

You can find me over at [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/rairaDraws) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilajomok). In my spare time, I draw and create comics. You can find some of my work and art blog at [Raira Draws](https://rairadraws.wordpress.com/).
